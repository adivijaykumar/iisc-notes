Entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical resource that plays a key role in many of the
most interesting applications of quantum computation and quantum information;
entanglement is iron to the classical worldâ€™s bronze age. In recent years there has been a
tremendous effort trying to better understand the properties of entanglement considered
as a fundamental resource of Nature, of comparable importance to energy, information,
entropy, or any other fundamental resource. Although there is as yet no complete theory
of entanglement, some progress has been made in understanding this strange property of
quantum mechanics. It is hoped by many researchers that further study of the properties
of entanglement will yield insights that facilitate the development of new applications in
quantum computation and quantum information.
